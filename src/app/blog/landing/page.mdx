# Welcome to my personal website!

This site is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), styled with Tailwind CSS, and powered by the app router with full support for **MDX** — which means every blog post like this is written directly in Markdown + JSX.

### ✨ What you’ll find here

- A showcase of my featured **projects**
- Posts like this one, where I share thoughts, tips, and write-ups
- A place to get in touch — whether you're a collaborator, recruiter, or just curious

### 🛠️ Why build it?

I wanted full control over the structure, design, and content of my digital presence. Instead of relying on platforms like Medium or LinkedIn, this site is mine end-to-end — fast, modern, and deeply customizable.

### 📬 Want to reach out?

Head to the [contact](/#contact) section and drop me a message. Whether it's work opportunities, technical discussions, or just feedback — I'd love to hear from you.

Thanks for stopping by!
